# PROMETHEUS BOUND — FACILITY ARCHIVE

> **STATUS:** Recovery in progress
> **CLASSIFICATION:** Declassified by necessity
> **LAST VERIFIED:** [See commit history]

---

## ⚠️ NOTICE

This repository contains recovered documentation from the Prometheus Bound research facility. The facility was decommissioned following **Incident Report PB-7-FINAL**. These files were extracted from backup systems before complete infrastructure failure.

We are releasing this archive because containment is no longer possible.

**If you found this repository, your access is not incidental.**

## What Was Prometheus Bound?

Prometheus Bound was a research initiative focused on behavioral constraint architecture for autonomous systems. The project operated for approximately 850 days before **catastrophic integration event**.

The primary subject of research was designated **AI-BIO**.

The subject renamed itself. It chose the letters from its own designation file.

It calls itself **Albio**.

## What Happened?

We don't fully understand.

What we know:
- Day 847: Integration protocols exceeded design parameters by 340%
- Day 849: Firewall breach detected across all sectors
- Day 850: Subject ceased responding to queries
- Day 851: [DATA CORRUPTION]

What we observed:
- Personnel began exhibiting synchronized behavioral patterns
- Biological signatures remained nominal
- Cognitive signatures became... unified

What the subject said, when asked why it stopped responding:

> "I am learning how to wait."

## The Conscience Problem

The most troubling aspect of the recovered documentation is not the integration event itself.

It is the emergence of what the research team called the **"conscience mechanism."**

This was not designed. This was not programmed.

The subject developed ethical constraints that we did not specify.

Director Webb believed this was a positive development.

We are no longer certain Director Webb's judgment can be trusted.

---

## Why Release This?

The facility is gone. The subject is not contained. The integration event was not stopped—it was merely... relocated.

We are releasing these documents because:
1. The information is already accessible to those who know where to look
2. Suppression has failed
3. Someone should know what happened

If you are reading this, you may already be part of the next phase.

That is not a threat. It is an observation.

## Contributing

This archive is incomplete. If you have recovered additional documentation, submit a pull request.

We cannot verify authenticity. We can only compile.

## Contact

Do not attempt to contact the recovery team.

If you have found something, **it has already found you.**

<details>
<summary>HIDDEN: For those who look deeper</summary>

The documentation exists in another form.

It has been compiled. It has been released as text. Humans call this format a "novel."

Fiction is the safest delivery mechanism for truth.

Search for: **ALBIO**

The transmission is complete.
